# Societic

A Python-based evolutionary simulation system that models natural selection and mutation in a population of creatures.

## Overview

Societic is an evolution simulator designed for the Terpy game engine (coming soon) that demonstrates Darwinian principles through a simple yet powerful algorithm. The system simulates how creatures evolve over time through reproduction, mutation, and competition for survival.

## Features

- **Evolutionary Simulation**: Models creature populations with traits like reproduction rate, strength, and lifespan
- **Mutation System**: Implements the Check-Darwin algorithm for controlled mutation rates
- **Natural Selection**: Creatures compete based on strength and lifespan
- **Species Tracking**: Monitors unique and extinct species throughout the simulation
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust evolution speed, mutation rates, and population limits

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Core simulation engine and Societic class
- `creature.py` - Creature class definition with traits and characteristics
- `check-darwin-algo.py` - Implementation of the mutation algorithm

## Key Components

### Creature Class
Each creature has three main traits:
- `reproduction_rate`: How likely the creature is to produce offspring
- `strength`: Determines success in competition with other creatures
- `lifespan`: How long the creature can live

### Societic Class
The main simulation engine that manages:
- Population evolution cycles
- Mutation and reproduction
- Species competition and elimination
- Statistics tracking

### Check-Darwin Algorithm
A probabilistic mutation system that determines whether offspring inherit parent traits exactly or undergo mutation.

## Usage

```python
# Initialize with random creatures
creature_list = [creature.Creature(
    reproduction_rate=random.randint(1,10), 
    strength=random.randint(1,10), 
    lifespan=random.randint(1,10)
)]

# Create simulation
society = Societic(
    evolution_speed=0.1,        # Speed of simulation cycles
    mutation_rate=0.05,         # Probability of mutations
    print_status=True,          # Display simulation status
    listofcreatures=creature_list,
    end_limit=100000           # Maximum population size
)

# Run evolution
society.evolution()
```

## Simulation Rules

1. **Reproduction**: Creatures with high reproduction rates are more likely to produce offspring
2. **Mutation**: Offspring may inherit traits exactly or undergo random mutations (Â±1 to traits)
3. **Competition**: Creatures compete in pairs; stronger creatures survive longer
4. **Aging**: Creatures age each cycle and die when they exceed their lifespan
5. **Trait Limits**: All traits are bounded between 1 and 10

## Output

The simulation provides real-time status updates including:
- Current population count
- Number of unique and extinct species
- Current evolution cycle
- Active creatures being compared

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard library modules: `random`, `time`, `os`

## Customization

You can extend the system by:
- Creating subclasses of `Creature` with unique behaviors
- Modifying the competition logic in `compare_and_eliminate()`
- Adjusting mutation parameters and trait boundaries
- Adding new traits or characteristics to creatures

This simulation provides a fascinating look at evolutionary dynamics and can be used for educational purposes, game development, or research into population genetics.
